# FTP Server (my_ftp)
* binary name: **myftp**
* language: **C**
* compilation: via **Makefile** (all, clean, fclean, re)

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a FTP server.
You MUST implement request sequences that are explained in the protocol (more information could be
find in RFC959).
The network communication will be achieved through the use of TCP sockets.

## Server

```
USAGE: ./myftp port path
    port is the port number on which the server socket listens
    path is the path to the home directory for the Anonymous user
```

The server is able to handle several clients at the same time by using select for command management and fork for data transfer

The server has an authentication with an Anonymous account and an empty password.
Data transfers uses active or passive mode.

## Client

You can use any ftp client.
I also made one that you can use...
 ```cd src/client && make``` **or** ```make``` at root.

## Commands

```
USER <SP> <username> <CRLF>   : Specify user for authentication
PASS <SP> <password> <CRLF>   : Specify password for authentication

CWD  <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>   : Change working directory
CDUP <CRLF>                   : Change working directory to parent directory

PASV <CRLF>                   : Enable "passive" mode for data transfer

PORT <SP> <host-port> <CRLF>  : Enable "active" mode for data transfer


HELP [<SP> <string>] <CRLF>   : List available commands
